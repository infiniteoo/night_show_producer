# Night Show Producer v1.0

Night Show Producer is a very simple program that turns a "music log" PDF (generated by a music scheduling app such as Selector or Music Master), a directory full of songs, a collection of dry audio pieces from a radio disc jockey, and exports a fully-produced radio show, complete with imaging pieces between songs, custom new music intros, automated music beds, and then segments them into their appropriate pieces, completely ready for on-air play.  **All with the click of a few buttons!**

### Introduction

This is the program that started it all!  The app that ultimately led my down the path of wanting to be a developer.  It's not much to look at, but I'm proud to say this bad boy got a good two years of real-world, on-air execution for a nationally-syndicated radio show.

I had zero experience with Java before embarking on this adventure, and ended up taking an amazing online Java course taught by the University of Helsinki called MOOC: https://java-programming.mooc.fi/

This project started with a simple Google search: `combine audio files java`

#### History

While most radio shows today are generated through really expensive automation software, such as iHeartRadio's Zetta (NexGen), a lot of shows are still put together - to this day - the old fashioned by: by hand, through laborious repeated manual labor of dragging virtual boxes around over and over again.

##### The Process Before

* A music director would generate a "music log" through their scheduling software of choice, which would create either a PDF or a TXT file of the sequence of events that comprise the radio show: songs, DJ talk breaks, commercials, imaging pieces ("sweepers"), and others.  Here is the log used in the demo for this app:
